# Code Review: Adding Commit Message Generation and Review Export Functionality

This pull request introduces significant enhancements to the code review agent, enabling it to generate conventional commit messages and export code reviews to markdown files.

## Summary of Changes:

*   **`index.ts`**: Updated agent configuration to include new tools and adjusted the prompt to leverage these capabilities.
*   **`prompts.ts`**: Enhanced the system prompt to explicitly inform the agent about the new tools and their importance.
*   **`tools.ts`**: Implemented `generateCommitMessageTool` and `writeReviewToFileTool`, along with their respective schemas and execution logic.

## File-by-File Review:

### `index.ts`

*   **Good**: The import statements and tool registrations are correctly added, ensuring the agent has access to the new functionalities. The updated prompt is clear and directs the agent to utilize these new tools.

### `prompts.ts`

*   **Good**: Clearly outlining the available tools and emphasizing their mandatory use in the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` is excellent. This will significantly improve the agent's ability to respond comprehensively and utilize all its capabilities.

### `tools.ts`

*   **Correctness & Clarity**:
    *   **`generateCommitMessage`**: The logic for generating a conventional commit message is well-structured. It effectively identifies new files versus modified files and constructs a readable commit message, including a file count and a list of affected files for smaller changes. This is a thoughtful implementation.
    *   **`writeReviewToFile`**: This function is straightforward and correctly utilizes `writeFileSync` to save the review content to a markdown file. The default filename `review.md` is a good choice.
*   **Maintainability**: The use of `zod` schemas for input validation (`commitMessage`, `writeReviewToFileSchema`) is a good practice, enhancing the robustness and clarity of the tool definitions.
*   **Suggestion (Minor/Robustness)**:
    *   Consider adding basic error handling (e.g., a `try-catch` block around `writeFileSync`) in `writeReviewToFile` to gracefully manage potential file writing issues, although for this specific application, it might not be strictly necessary.
    *   **Nit**: In `generateCommitMessage`, the check `file.includes('new file')` for identifying new files might be slightly brittle if the `simple-git` diff output format changes in future versions. While likely stable, a more direct check against diff headers could offer more robustness. However, for the current implementation and typical diff outputs, this is probably fine.

## Overall Feedback:

This is a well-implemented set of changes that significantly enhances the utility of the code review agent. The new tools are clearly defined and integrated, and the logic within `tools.ts` is clean and effective. Good job!
